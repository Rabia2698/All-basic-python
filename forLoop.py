# This code demonstrates the use of a for loop in Python.
# It iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to 4 and prints the current iteration number.

for i in range(5):
    print("loop iteration:", i + 1)
# This code demonstrates the use of a for loop in Python.
# It iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to 4 and prints the current iteration number incremented by 1.
# The output will be 1 to 5 instead of 0 to 4.
