# What I learn in this repository

## HelloWorld.py
In this file, I learned how to use the ``print()`` function in Python. It's used to display text (strings) or numbers stored in variables.

Example:  
**variable**         : greeting  
**string stored**    : Hello World  
**function used**    : print  

## forLoop.py
This file shows how to use for loops to repeat actions a specific number of times, often used to iterate through lists or ranges.

## while_loop.py
Here, I practiced using while loops, which repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

## function.py
I learned how to define and call functions in Python to organize and reuse blocks of code.

## logic_ifelse_statement.py
This script demonstrates how to use if, elif, and else statements to make decisions based on conditions.

## math.py
Basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and using the math module are covered here.

## try.py
This file introduces error handling using try and except blocks to prevent programs from crashing due to runtime errors.

## append.py
In this script, I learned how to use the append() method to add items to a list.

## create_table.py
This file shows how to create and display a simple table using lists and loops.

## main.py
In this main file, I run a simple program **Record Student Grade** by using all the knowledge I learn.
